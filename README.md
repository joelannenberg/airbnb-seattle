## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code requires Python 3, as well as the following libraries: Jupyter, NumPy, and Pandas.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I used AirBnB listings data for Seattle to answer the following questions:

1. When is the most affordable time to visit Seattle?
2. Which neighborhoods are the most highly rated, and what is the average price?
3. What kinds of rentals are available in those neighborhoods?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are three data files that were used in the analysis:
1. calendar.csv - contains listing IDs, if they are available, and at what price for various dates out of the year.
2. listings.csv - contains various datapoints per listing, including location data and average review scores.
3. reviews.csv - contains user reviews of different listings.

Analysis.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook that was used to analyze the data.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found within the Medium post located [here](https://joel-annenberg.medium.com/you-can-finally-travel-again-now-what-fc7a308e48b).
